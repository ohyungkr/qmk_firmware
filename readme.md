Official QMK firmware for Keychron and Lemokey keyboards. This repository contains the firmware source, build configurations, and keymaps for 63+ boards across the Q, Q HE, Q Max, K HE, K Max, K Pro, V, V Max, C Pro, S, X, and Lemokey series.

## Why Open Source?

Keychron is the first major keyboard brand to fully open-source both its [firmware](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware) and [hardware design](https://github.com/Keychron/Keychron-Keyboards-Hardware-Design). We believe you should be able to see, verify, and modify every line of code that runs on your keyboard. Open source means full transparency — no black boxes between you and your hardware.

We also want to build something bigger than what any single company can do alone. By opening our firmware to the community, developers and enthusiasts can push what keyboards are capable of — custom keymaps, new features, creative workflows — and those contributions make every Keychron keyboard better for everyone.

## Features

- **Hall Effect magnetic switch support** — adjustable actuation and rapid trigger on HE boards
- **Wireless connectivity** — Bluetooth 5.1 and 2.4 GHz firmware for wireless models
- **[Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/)** — remap keys, tune HE settings, and configure lighting from your browser with no setup
- **RGB Matrix lighting** — per-key RGB effects and customization
- **Multiple layout variants** — ANSI, ISO, and JIS for every supported board
- **Full QMK feature set** — layers, tap-dance, combos, macros, encoders, OLED, and more

## Getting Started

### Option A: Use Keychron Launcher (no code required)

If you just want to remap keys, tune Hall Effect settings, or change lighting, you don't need to build firmware:

1. Open [Keychron Launcher](https://launcher.keychron.com/) in a Chromium-based browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, or Vivaldi
2. Connect your Keychron keyboard via USB
3. Remap keys, configure layers, adjust lighting, and fine-tune HE sensitivity — changes apply instantly

Keychron Launcher works out of the box with no JSON import required, and supports features beyond VIA such as Hall Effect actuation point tuning and rapid trigger configuration. Safari and other non-Chromium browsers will not work with Keychron Launcher.

### Option B: Build from source

### 2. 펌웨어 컴파일 (Compile)
QMK MSYS 터미널을 실행 후 본 디렉토리로 이동하여 아래 명령어를 실행합니다:

```bash
# Keychron Q5 Max ANSI Encoder 타겟 펌웨어 빌드
qmk compile -kb keychron/q5_max/ansi_encoder -km keychron
# 또는
make keychron/q5_max/ansi_encoder:keychron
```

빌드가 성공하면 `.build/` 디렉토리에 `keychron_q5_max_ansi_encoder_keychron.bin` 산출물이 생성됩니다.
